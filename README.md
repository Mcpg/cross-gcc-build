# build-gcc
This repository contains a script that builds
GCC cross compiler. It's basically automation of
instructions from
[GCC Cross-Compiler article on OS Dev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler)

Requirements are all of the packages required
by the tutorial + `wget` and `tar` for downloading
and extracting gcc and binutils.

At the top of the script there are a few variables
you can change.
